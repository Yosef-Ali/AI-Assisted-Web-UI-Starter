# MCP-Driven Development Workflow

## Development Cycle

### 1. Specification Phase
- Use AI to analyze requirements
- Generate spec.md from business needs
- Define acceptance criteria

### 2. Planning Phase  
- Use Next.js MCP to scaffold project structure
- Use Shadcn MCP to identify needed components
- Create technical architecture

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Use Next.js MCP for routing and API setup
- Use Shadcn MCP to add UI components
- Use Playwright MCP for continuous testing

### 4. Verification Phase
- Use Playwright MCP for visual regression
- Test at multiple breakpoints
- Verify accessibility

## MCP Tool Usage Patterns

### For Feature Development
1. Next.js MCP: Create route/page
2. Shadcn MCP: Add required components
3. Next.js MCP: Implement API routes
4. Playwright MCP: Test the feature

### For UI Updates
1. Shadcn MCP: List available components
2. Shadcn MCP: Install components
3. File operations: Customize components
4. Playwright MCP: Visual verification

### For Testing
1. Playwright MCP: Navigate to page
2. Playwright MCP: Interact with elements
3. Playwright MCP: Capture screenshots
4. Playwright MCP: Check console/network
