## Development Cycle

### 1. Specification Phase
- Use AI to analyze requirements
- Generate spec.md from business needs
- Define acceptance criteria

### 2. Planning Phase  
- Plan project structure and components needed
- Use Shadcn MCP to identify required UI components
- Create technical architecture

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Set up project structure manually or with AI assistance
- Use Shadcn MCP to add UI components
- Use Playwright MCP for continuous testing

### 4. Verification Phase
- Use Playwright MCP for visual regression
- Test at multiple breakpoints
- Verify accessibility
