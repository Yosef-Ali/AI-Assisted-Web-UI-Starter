# AI-Assisted-Web-UI-Starter Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modern React Architecture
Every component must follow React best practices with hooks, functional components, and modern patterns. Components must be self-contained, reusable, and follow the single responsibility principle. State management must use modern solutions like Context API or Zustand for complex state needs.

### II. TypeScript Excellence
All code must be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. Interfaces and types must be explicitly defined for all data structures, component props, and API responses. Generic types must be used appropriately to ensure type safety and maintainability.

### III. Accessibility First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every user interface element must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Semantic HTML must be used, ARIA attributes applied where needed, and keyboard navigation fully supported. Color contrast ratios must be maintained, and screen reader compatibility verified for all interactive elements.

### IV. Component-Driven Development
UI must be built using a component library approach with Shadcn/ui. Components must be designed for reusability, have comprehensive prop interfaces, and include proper TypeScript definitions. Storybook or similar tools must be used for component documentation and testing.

### V. Performance & Quality
Applications must achieve Lighthouse scores above 90 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. Bundle size must be optimized, images compressed, and Core Web Vitals met. Code must pass ESLint and Prettier checks, with comprehensive test coverage maintained.

## Technology Standards

### Frontend Framework
- **React**: 18+ with modern hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: 5.0+ with strict mode enabled
- **Next.js**: 15+ with App Router for optimal performance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible components

### Development Tools
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in (no custom webpack config)
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E, Jest for unit tests
- **Linting**: ESLint with React and accessibility rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier with consistent code style
- **Git**: Conventional commits with semantic versioning

### Performance Standards
- **Lighthouse Score**: >90 on all metrics
- **Core Web Vitals**: All metrics in "Good" range
- **Bundle Size**: <200KB for initial load
- **Time to Interactive**: <3 seconds on 3G

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
- All PRs must pass automated tests and linting
- Accessibility audit must pass before merge
- Performance regression tests must pass
- Code review required for all changes
- TypeScript compilation must succeed with zero errors

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all utility functions and hooks
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for critical user journeys using Playwright
- Accessibility testing automated in CI/CD
- Visual regression testing for UI components

### Deployment Process
- Automated deployment via Vercel or similar platform
- Staging environment for testing before production
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Rollback capability within 5 minutes
- Monitoring and alerting for performance issues

## Governance

This constitution establishes the foundational principles for the AI-Assisted-Web-UI-Starter project. All development decisions must align with these principles, with accessibility and TypeScript excellence being non-negotiable requirements.

Amendments to this constitution require:
1. Clear justification for the change
2. Impact assessment on existing code and processes
3. Approval from project maintainers
4. Migration plan for implementation
5. Updated version number following semantic versioning

All code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified and alternatives considered. Use this constitution as the primary reference for development decisions.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-09-20 | **Last Amended**: 2025-09-20
