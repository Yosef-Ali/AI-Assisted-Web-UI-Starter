Using the MCP servers available:
1. Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
2. Initialize Shadcn UI with a New York style and slate color
3. Install essential components (button, card, form, navigation)
4. Set up a basic layout with header and footer
5. Verify everything works with Playwright
```

Using Shadcn MCP:
- List all available components
- Show me components related to [forms/navigation/data display]

- Update all components to latest versions
```

## Page Creation
```
Create a new page at /dashboard with Shadcn components
Set up API route at /api/users
