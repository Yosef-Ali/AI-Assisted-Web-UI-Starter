# AI Prompt Library for MCP Development

## Initial Setup
```
Using the MCP servers available:
1. Create a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
2. Initialize Shadcn UI with a New York style and slate color
3. Install essential components (button, card, form, navigation)
4. Set up a basic layout with header and footer
5. Verify everything works with Playwright
```

Using Shadcn MCP:
- List all available components
- Show me components related to [forms/navigation/data display]
- Install [component-name] and its dependencies
- Update all components to latest versions
```

## Page Creation
```
Using Next.js MCP:
- Create a new page at /dashboard
- Set up API route at /api/users
- Add middleware for authentication

```

## Testing
```
Using Playwright MCP:
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000
- Take screenshots at all breakpoints
- Test form submission on /contact

I need a user authentication system:
1. Use Next.js MCP to create /login and /register pages
2. Use Shadcn MCP to add form, input, button, card components
3. Use Next.js MCP to create /api/auth routes
4. Use Playwright MCP to test the login flow
