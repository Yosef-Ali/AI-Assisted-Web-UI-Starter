# Tasks: User Dashboard with Analytics

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-user/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies
- Tests (T007-T025) before implementation (T026-T059)
- TypeScript interfaces (T026-T032) before components (T037-T048)
- API client (T033) before query hooks (T034-T036)
- Components before pages (T049)
- API routes (T050-T053) before integration (T060-T067)
- Implementation before polish (T068-T083)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T007-T016 together (contract tests):
Task: "Contract test GET /dashboards in __tests__/contract/test_dashboards_get.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /dashboards in __tests__/contract/test_dashboards_post.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /dashboards/{id} in __tests__/contract/test_dashboard_get.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test PUT /dashboards/{id} in __tests__/contract/test_dashboard_update.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test DELETE /dashboards/{id} in __tests__/contract/test_dashboard_delete.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /dashboards/{id}/charts in __tests__/contract/test_dashboard_charts_get.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /dashboards/{id}/charts in __tests__/contract/test_dashboard_charts_post.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /charts/{id}/data in __tests__/contract/test_chart_data_get.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /metrics in __tests__/contract/test_metrics_get.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /export/dashboard/{id} in __tests__/contract/test_export_get.test.ts"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task</content>
