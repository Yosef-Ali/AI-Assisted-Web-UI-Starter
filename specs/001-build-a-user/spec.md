# Feature Specification: User Dashboard with Analytics

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-user`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a user dashboard with analytics charts and real-time data"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to access a dashboard that displays my key metrics and performance indicators through visual charts, so that I can quickly understand my data trends and make informed decisions without having to analyze raw numbers manually.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is logged into the system, **When** they navigate to the dashboard, **Then** they should see their personalized analytics charts loading within 3 seconds
2. **Given** real-time data is being updated in the background, **When** new data becomes available, **Then** the charts should update automatically without requiring a page refresh
3. **Given** a user is viewing the dashboard on a mobile device, **When** they rotate their screen, **Then** the charts should adapt to the new orientation while maintaining readability
4. **Given** a user has no data available, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they should see a helpful empty state with guidance on how to generate data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the real-time data connection is lost?
- How does the system handle very large datasets that might impact performance?
- What occurs when a user has multiple data sources that conflict?
- How should the dashboard behave during system maintenance or outages?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display analytics data in visual chart formats (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts)
- **FR-002**: System MUST update dashboard data in real-time without manual refresh
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to customize which metrics are displayed on their dashboard
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide data filtering and time range selection capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure all charts are accessible to users with disabilities
- **FR-006**: System MUST display data loading states and error states appropriately
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to export dashboard data in common formats
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide responsive design that works on all device sizes
- **FR-009**: System MUST cache dashboard data to improve performance [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: cache duration and invalidation strategy not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST notify users of significant data changes or anomalies [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what constitutes "significant" changes]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Dashboard**: User's personalized view containing charts and metrics
- **Chart**: Visual representation of data with configurable display options
- **Metric**: Individual data point or KPI being tracked and displayed
- **Data Source**: External system or database providing the analytics data
- **Time Range**: User-defined period for which data is displayed
