## üéØ Specification: User Authentication & Database Persistence

### User Story
As a **dashboard user**, I want to:
- **Sign in** with my Google/GitHub account or email/password
- **Create and manage** my own personal dashboards
- **Share dashboards** with other users (public/private)
- **Persist my data** so it's available across sessions and devices
- **Manage my profile** and preferences

### Business Requirements

#### Authentication Requirements
1. **Multiple Sign-in Methods**
   - OAuth providers: Google, GitHub
   - Email/password authentication
   - Secure session management
   - Password reset functionality

2. **User Management**
   - User registration flow
   - Profile management (name, email, avatar)
   - Account settings and preferences
   - Account deletion/deactivation

#### Data Persistence Requirements
1. **User-Owned Dashboards**
   - Each dashboard belongs to a specific user
   - Users can create, edit, delete their dashboards
   - Dashboard metadata (name, description, created/updated dates)
   - Custom dashboard layouts and configurations

2. **Chart Data Management**
   - User-specific chart configurations
   - Chart positioning and sizing
   - Chart data sources and filters
   - Real-time updates for authenticated users

3. **Sharing & Permissions**
   - Public dashboards (viewable by anyone)
   - Private dashboards (owner only)
   - Shared dashboards (specific users)
   - Read-only vs edit permissions

### Technical Requirements

#### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: id, email, name, avatar, preferences, created_at, updated_at
- **Dashboards Table**: id, user_id, name, description, layout, is_public, created_at, updated_at
- **Charts Table**: id, dashboard_id, title, type, config, position, size, created_at, updated_at
- **Dashboard_Shares Table**: id, dashboard_id, shared_with_user_id, permission_level

#### API Changes
- **Protected Routes**: All `/api/dashboards` routes require authentication
- **User Context**: API responses filtered by user ownership
- **Permission Checks**: Verify user can access/modify resources
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism

#### Frontend Changes
- **Auth Components**: Login, register, logout, profile pages
- **Route Protection**: Redirect unauthenticated users to login
- **User Context**: React context for current user state
- **Loading States**: Handle auth loading and errors gracefully

### Integration Points

#### Supabase Integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Supabase hosting
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth with social providers
- **Realtime**: Supabase realtime for collaborative features
- **Storage**: User avatars and assets

#### Next.js Integration
- **Middleware**: Route protection at edge level
- **Server Components**: Server-side user context
- **API Routes**: Protected with user session checks
- **Client Components**: Auth state management

### Success Criteria

#### Functional Success
- ‚úÖ Users can sign in with Google/GitHub/email
- ‚úÖ Users can create and manage personal dashboards
- ‚úÖ Dashboard data persists across sessions
- ‚úÖ Users can share dashboards with others
- ‚úÖ All routes properly protected

#### Technical Success
- ‚úÖ Database schema supports multi-user requirements
- ‚úÖ API routes properly filter data by user
- ‚úÖ Authentication state managed efficiently
- ‚úÖ Performance remains optimal with user data
- ‚úÖ Security best practices implemented

#### User Experience Success

- ‚úÖ Responsive auth UI on all devices
- ‚úÖ Helpful error messages and loading states
- ‚úÖ Smooth onboarding for new users

### Non-Requirements (Out of Scope)
- ‚ùå Advanced role-based permissions (admin, editor, viewer)
- ‚ùå Team/organization management
- ‚ùå Payment/subscription features
- ‚ùå Advanced collaboration (real-time editing)
- ‚ùå Dashboard versioning/history

## üîÑ Next Steps in Spec-Driven Workflow

1. **Review & Approve Spec** - Confirm requirements are complete
2. **`/plan`** - Create technical implementation plan
3. **`/tasks`** - Break down into actionable development tasks
4. **`/implement`** - Execute using MCP servers (Supabase, Shadcn, Playwright)
